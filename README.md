First I install the react.js and check the version and set up in the vscode editor. Getting Started with Create React notes App This project was bootstrapped with Create React notes App.

Available Scripts In the project directory, you can run: Create React apps with no build configuration.

Creating an App – How to create a new app. User Guide – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Create React App.

Quick Overview npx create-react-app my-app cd my-app npm start If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app, we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app or yarn global remove create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

(npx comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

Then open http://localhost:3000 to see your app. When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with npm run build.

npm start

Get Started Immediately You don’t need to install or configure tools like webpack or Babel. They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Create a project, and you’re good to go.

Creating an App You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine. We recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use nvm (nvm-windows to switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

npx npx create-react-app my-app (npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

npm npm init react-app my-app npm init initializer is available in npm 6+

Yarn yarn create react-app my-app yarn create is available in Yarn 0.25+

It will create a directory called my-app inside the current folder. Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

my-app ├── README.md ├── node_modules ├── package.json ├── .gitignore ├── public │ ├── favicon.ico │ ├── index.html │ └── manifest.json └── src ├── App.css ├── App.js ├── App.test.js ├── index.css ├── index.js ├── logo.svg └── serviceWorker.js └── setupTests.js No configuration or complicated folder structures, only the files you need to build your app. Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

cd my-app Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

npm start or yarn start Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code. You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

Build errors

npm test or yarn test Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode. By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

Read more about testing.

npm run build or yarn build Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed.

User Guide:https://www.w3schools.com/react/default.asp You can find detailed instructions on using Create React App and many tips in its documentation.

How to Update to New Versions:https://reactjs.org/versions/ Please refer to the User Guide for this and other information.

Philosophy:https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-philosophy/ One Dependency: There is only one build dependency. It uses webpack, Babel, ESLint, and other amazing projects, but provides a cohesive curated experience on top of them.

No Configuration Required: You don't need to configure anything. A reasonably good configuration of both development and production builds is handled for you so you can focus on writing code.

No Lock-In: You can “eject” to a custom setup at any time. Run a single command, and all…

in this notes app i used the some of the operations insert, delete,searching,edit so on.and also i used the some of the concepts like react hooks,to-do-list,json and so on....

And finally i completed the POC and i take some of the screenshots and paste it in the github.
